# Part-B-Mailbot-2-Judgment-Day

Continuing your work as software contractors, you have been rehired by XYZ Company (XYZ)
to address further issues with their product AutoMail. As you are aware, XYZ use a simulation framework to
test out strategies (for example, for MailPool and Robot operation). However, XYZ’s experience in improving
such strategies (with your help) has made them aware that the simulation framework itself, while functional, is
not up to standard from a design perspective. The designers did not consistently apply good design principles,
and have ended up with a system which is not sufficiently flexible or modifiable.
Your first task is to pass judgement on the existing software package, that is, to provide a detailed analysis
of the package, highlighting inappropriate design decisions. Having completed this task, you will then be
required to redesign and refactor the existing package applying good design principles and patterns to improve
the flexibility and modifiability of the simulation platform to cope with XYZ’s changing needs. Finally, having
improved the design, you are to extend the design to support some additional functionality and modify the
existing simulation to match your modified design.
